# A portfolio website template - by Umar Qureshi
## Introduction
This is an open-source website template which can be downloaded and used by anyone. I used this to test out some features in HTML, but you can either make a portfolio website out of it, or create something of your own with my template - it's up to you.  
## How it works
You can add, edit or remove anything from the website. For starters, you can remove the text and add your own text. This template more suits a portfolio website, but you can do whatever you like with this template.  
  
If you are looking to change anything in terms of the format of the webpages, then look in the CSS file. Make sure the edits you apply to one HTML webpage is applied to the other HTML webpages, as anything unchanged will be unbalance between the webpages.  
  
When you are editing buttons, give the `<button>` tag and `class` of `button ___`. `___` can be replaced with another class name of your choice.  
To edit the button, you must go the CSS file and add a section for your secondary class (`___`), and add the color of the text (`color:___;`) and the background color of the button (`background-color:___;`).  
Additionally, you can add a section for your secondary class when the cursor is being hovered over the button, by using the following syntax:  
  
``secondary class name:hover {  
    content here  
}``  
  
You can add separate colors here for when the button is being hovered over. The best combination of colors is the opposite color and background colors for the button when the cursor is not hovering over the button.  
  
The navigation bar is made up of HTML attributes. The active page is defined by the `active` class, which will make the specific attrbute linked to the page light up green depending on what page you are on. Everything will be written as comments to guide you on editing the certain features of the website.
